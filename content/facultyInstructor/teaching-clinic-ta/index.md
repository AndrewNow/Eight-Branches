Christine takes a holistic view toward the source of pain &amp; related movement limitation disorders. After asking detailed questions, examining closely the pulse, the tongue and palpating the affected
body (shape, color, temperature, marks etc.), Christine will come up with Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM) pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment plan. The efficacy of Traditional Chinese
Medicine derives from its strength in the body-mind communication and connection. Clients may
find comprehensive changes and cellular level recovery through a long-term meeting with TCM.
“Every human being is the author of his own health or disease.” The sickness provides a great
opportunity for us to enhance our life by re-reading the book of our body and its disorders. Christine
would like to accompany clients to go through the re-examination/interpretation of our body, and
also provide solutions for clients to resolve pains and disorders, strengthen body-mind connection
and further improve our life.
