“I have always been fascinated by the Eastern approach to life from the philosophy, to the martial arts to the healing arts”.

​

When he was 20 years old Dondrub began to practice Kung fu, the original definition being “excellence achieved through long practice in any endeavour”. The “endeavour” he chose to pursue was Chinese Martial Arts. “I studied for 10 years, and learned how to be in tune with my body on a much deeper level than I ever thought possible”. During that time he was also introduced to Buddhist meditation as well as Tai Chi Chuan. “When I practiced meditation I discovered how loud and busy my mind was and now I was given the tools to help me deal with my mind. With Tai Chi Chuan I discovered a way of practicing being quiet on the inside while moving on the outside”. During this time he began teaching Tai Chi Chuan to the public and discovered “the more I teach the more I learn”. He continues to learn from his students every day. At 27 Dondrub began to study Zen Shiatsu Therapy at Kokoro Dojo. During his 17 years at the Dojo he has learned the art of Zen Shiatsu. “I have learned that it is possible to bring my whole self into a treatment (to be completely there with my client), I have learned to breathe from my hara, I have learned how healing touch can be”. Currently, Dondrub is an Instructor of Tao Yin (Taoist Yoga), Tai Chi Chuan and Zen Shiatsu. He continues to pursue studies in Medical Qi gong.
