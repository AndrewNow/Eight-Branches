Meet Sarah Kreitzer, R. Ac and clinic owner of Acupuncture Center Toronto. A
pioneer Toronto Acupuncturist of over 20 years, Sarah has been so busy that she
has not accepted new patients in over 5 years. Sarah’s media appearances
include: The National Post, Diply, Global News, Theskiny blog,  Readers Digest,
Satellite XM radio, Canadian Living, Glow Magazine. She’s a go-to Acupuncturist
for celebrities and Rock Stars when visiting Toronto.


We invite you to learn how Sarah has influenced the incredible growth of her
Yorkville practice into the busiest Chinese Medicine Clinic in Canada. The clinic
only offers Traditional Chinese Medicine and is proudly a general practice. Last
year, her team of over 12 Associates saw over 5000 appointments during a “slow”
pandemic year of 2021. Several of the Center’s most successful Associates are
graduates of Eight Branches and in line with the school’s values. Sarah has some
tips and strategies she’d love to share on how to build a bomb-proof practice. She
believes at the heart of a successful career is old fashioned patient service,
kindness and hard work. She’s exited to share how Acupuncture Center Toronto
has developed a respected local brand reputation as well as landmarking the
practice on a digital ecosystem. Sarah is an entrepreneur, a well-rounded general
practice R. Ac and friendly. She’s very much looking forward to meeting Eight
Branches students!
