Acupuncturist and Manual Therapist

I began teaching cupping (and other courses) at the Shiatsu School of Canada in 2009, and since diving deeper into the history and techniques of cupping, as well as studying from some cupping experts I started to explore how cupping could be better utilized as a manual therapy for East Asian Medicine practitioners.
