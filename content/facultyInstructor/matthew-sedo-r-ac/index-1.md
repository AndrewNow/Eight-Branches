“I feel lucky to have found a career that I love and continue to learn and grow with. I’ve been working with clients on their road to better heath since 2002.” Matt’s interest in healing grew out of a background in competitive diving. His first introduction to Chinese medicine was through his diving coach from China, who would use acupuncture and massage to manage injuries and relax divers before competitions. “I had little idea about what it was at the time but remember thinking… this is amazing… I want to learn this!” After university, Matt moved to Japan where he was fortunate enough to study shiatsu with a few great teachers. This sent him on a path back to Canada where he enrolled in the Shiatsu School of Canada and completed a diploma in Shiatsu and later Acupuncture. Matt apprenticed at a local tuina and acupuncture clinic in Toronto and immediately fell in love with the practice. Tuina as been a staple part of his acupuncture practice ever since. His clinical focus centers around providing pain management, rehabilitation and stress relief. He approaches treatment through a traditional Chinese medical framework and a contemporary understanding of neuroanatomy, pain and dysfunction. Matt is thrilled to pass on to students what he’s learned and is still discovering.
