Paul Rooney is a NYS licensed, nationally board certified acupuncturist. His clinic has been located in Rochester, NY since 1997.

Paul grew up in Westchester County, NY. He completed his bachelor’s degree in international relations and economics from Syracuse University in 1992. After college he lived in Prague, Czech Republic for a year, working as a journalist and teaching English.

Paul’s entrance into Traditional Oriental Medicine started in Thailand in 1993, where he studied Buddhism in a jungle monastery as a novice monk for six months. It is a common practice in Thailand for men to enter a monastery for several months at a time as a means to center and to focus their lives.

During his stay in Thailand Paul became curious about Oriental Medicine.  His interest eventually motivated him to attend Seattle’s Northwest Institute of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.

After three and half years of study and clinical practice, he graduated with a master’s degree and a passion for Oriental healing arts. During his training he found that he has a real talent and instinct for this profession.

Paul moved back to the east coast and chose Rochester as his future home and place of business. He loves the climate, the landscape, and the cultural and social opportunities Rochester offers.

Paul continually learns and expands his skills. He regularly attends Traditional Oriental Medicine seminars and classes to learn about new research and developments as well as gain insights into the classic texts from clinicians and scholars, some of which are over 2,000 years old. He maintains working relationships with medical doctors, chiropractors, physical therapists, massage therapists, trainers, and nutritionists. A number of physicians, pain clinics, and chiropractors regularly refer their patients to Paul. Paul has also been [interviewed](https://www.rochesteracupuncture.com/about_06.html) several times by local newspapers and TV stations.

Paul’s gentle, mindful, and often humorous communication style helps his patients to relax with the healing process of acupuncture. They feel free to ask any questions and to explore their options. Patients often send their family and friends to Paul with their highest recommendations.

Paul’s goal is to maintain the high quality of service that he has established from the beginning. His practice has grown largely by word of mouth, and Paul regards that as a true compliment.
