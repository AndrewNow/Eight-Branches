After completing a degree from Queen’s University in Life Sciences (B.Sc), Tim devoted a decade of his life to the study of Chinese Medicine, including an eight year stay in the People’s Republic of China. He spent three years in Beijing (studying the Mandarin dialect) before moving to Shanghai to enrol in a five-year Mandarin-language, dual-degree medical program (in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture/Tuina) at the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (B.Med). During this process, he was taught traditional Chinese herbs, formulas, acupuncture, moxibustion, and tuina therapeutic massage as well as Western medical theory and practice in internal and surgical medicine. Aside from medicine, he is an accomplished teacher of martial arts, qigong, and meditation, having studied extensively with some of the world's top lineage grandmasters in the Chen style Tai Chi and Xinyi LiuHe internal systems for over 12 years.
