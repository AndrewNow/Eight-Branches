Medical Esthetics is an under-represented area of opportunity for regulated health professionals. The non-
invasive anti-aging procedures are a rapidly growing industry, yet there are limited options to advance integumentary studies in areas of skin disease and anti- aging within the regulated health professionals like acupuncturists and naturopathic doctors. While pharmaceutical treatments may be indicated in severe skin
pathologies, natural medicine is a safe and effective method for early interventions, prevention and care for
common skin conditions. This course will include: 

Understanding of energy/light based based esthetic modalities
in treatment of integumentary conditions.

1. Learn to DDX skin conditions and when to refer.
2. Understand skin care ingredients and how best to use them for varying skin conditions- actives, enzymes and carriers-Natural vs pharmaceutical ingredients.
3. The role of acupuncture and other natural therapies in meditating skin pathologies.
4. Learn how to incorporate these procedures into your practice to immediate generate revenue.
