Please join Dr. Bella Tan for an enlightening and educational presentation on maintaining health during the colder seasons! Dr. Tan will be addressing 5-element balance and invigorating Kidney Fire as we move from the chill of Metal Element season (Autumn), in preparation for the depths and cold of Water Element season (Winter).

This presentation will be approximately 45 minutes long and will include a detailed summary of the Huang Di Nei Jing (the Yellow Emperor Classic of Medicine), and the preeminent foundational text of TCM in antiquity. We look forward to seeing you in the Zoom classroom!
