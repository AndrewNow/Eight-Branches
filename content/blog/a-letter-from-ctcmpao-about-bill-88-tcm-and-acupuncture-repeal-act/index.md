Dear Premier Ford,

On February 28, 2022, we, the professional members of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario (CTCMPAO or the College), were informed via email by the College to members and stakeholders of the provincial government’s plan to “wind down the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners & Acupuncturists of Ontario.”

Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022 presented by Hon. Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, resolves to introduce “legislative changes…that would, if passed, deliver better protections, bigger pay cheques and greater opportunities for workers and their families.”

As per the Ontario Government Newsroom press release, Schedule 5 of Bill 88, Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022  is intended to “Reduce barriers in the provision of traditional Chinese medicine while ensuring consumer protection in the delivery of traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture services.”

However, Schedule 5, Bill 88, Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 will not deliver better protections for your constituents, the general public, especially those constituents who choose to improve and support their health by accessing traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, nor will it provide bigger pay cheques and opportunities for members of the profession.  In fact, the TCM Repeal Act, 2022 will have the exact opposite effect.

We are respectfully bringing this to your attention for the following reasons:

1.	The Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 of Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022, Schedule 5, will remove the safeguards, standards of practice, and professional competencies required by CTCMPAO members. These are put into place to ensure the safety of the public; the very users of  traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture.


Traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture is a health profession currently regulated under the Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991 (RHPA) and the Traditional Chinese Medicine Act, 2006 (TCM Act).

The Traditional Chinese Medicine Act, 2006 (TCM Act) sets out:
●	The scope of practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): “…the assessment of body system disorders through traditional Chinese medicine techniques and treatment using traditional Chinese medicine therapies to promote, maintain or restore health”
●	The “controlled acts” that the members of the College are authorized to perform, namely:
●	Performing a procedure on tissue below the dermis and below the surface of a mucous membrane for the purpose of performing acupuncture;
●	Communication of a traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis identifying a body system disorder as the cause of a person’s symptoms using traditional Chinese medicine techniques
●	Title protection, authorizing only members of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario the use of the titles “traditional Chinese medicine practitioner” or “acupuncturist”, a variation or abbreviation

The email from the CTCMPAO further states that “the expectation is that acupuncture will be returned to the public domain and that TCM practitioners and acupuncturists could choose to voluntarily seek to be registered under the Health and Supportive Care Provides Oversight Authority.”

We, as registered TCM practitioners and acupuncturists, are shocked and outraged by this abrupt decision and have serious concerns about the direction the Ontario Government and the Ministry of Trades and Labour Relations intend to take.  

The CTCMPAO and regulation of TCM and acupuncture serve the interest of public safety and protection.  Dissolution of the CTCMPAO and the repealing of the TCM Act will have long-lasting and damaging impacts on the health and safety of the public.

Current regulation requires a full-time post-secondary traditional Chinese medicine program of at least four years, or a full-time post-secondary traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture program of at least three years, which includes both didactic and clinical training.

The clinical training is structured, comprehensive, supervised and evaluated, consisting of at least 45 weeks of clinical experience involving a minimum of 500 hours of direct patient contact.

These are the minimum entry level requirements for entry for our profession.

The de-regulation of our controlled acts will allow individuals who lack sufficient training, education, and experience to practice Chinese medicine.  In the hands of these individuals, whose skills have not been assessed, scrutinized, and deemed to have met our standards of practice and minimum professional competencies, performing acupuncture and communicating a Chinese medicine diagnosis could result in grave harm to and potentially even death for members of the general public.

The Ontario Government and Ministries of Labour, Training and Skills Development, and Health could  be held liable for these occurrences if they occur.

2.	The practice of Traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture is a regulated health profession.  As such, our profession is under the authority of the Ontario Ministry of Health and not the Ontario Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development.  
The Ministry of Trades and Labour Relations oversees the professions that fall outside the sphere of the provision of health care.  Trades do not have the same level of responsibility to protect the public from poor health, negative treatment outcomes, and death at the level  that regulated health care professionals do.  As such, this issue should be overseen by the Ministry of Health and not the Ministry of Trades and Labour Relations.

Bill 88 groups traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and acupuncturists together with other professions.  This does a disservice to our medicine, its rich history, and a lineage that goes back thousands of years.   

While we acknowledge that all work performed is valuable and honourable, the practice of TCM and acupuncture requires extensive training, education and the meeting of minimum practice competencies and skills.  TCM and acupuncture is a medical profession.  It has taken the weight of the allopathic medical system during this pandemic by maintaining proper infection control protocols and allowing patients to access health and wellness care.

Under the RHPA, 1991 and the TCM Act, 2006, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture are regulated health professions with a duty of care for the general public.  We, the members of the self-governing CTCMPAO are held to a higher standard of professionalism and ethical requirements than the trades and professions under the authority of the Ontario Ministry of Labour, Training and Development. 

As such, the profession should not be grouped with anything other than regulated health professions. The health of the citizens of Ontario should not be aligned with trades, ride-sharing drivers, and online digital contractors.


3.	The Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 of Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022, Schedule 5, is distinctly discriminatory as only the traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture profession is being singled out, despite there being twenty six health professions regulated under the RHPA.
Several other professions were regulated around the same time or after the TCM Act received Royal Assent in 2006 (Homeopathy Act, 2007, Kinesiology Act, 2007, Naturopathy Act, 2007, Psychotherapy Act, 2007).  Yet, of the twenty six self-governing professions regulated under the RHPA, only the TCM Act is being repealed in this bill.  

This is a targeted and deliberate attack on our profession. 

It is particularly appalling in light of what members of the Canadian and American Asian and Pacific Islander communities are facing today due to anti-Asian racial discrimination and acts of hate.

If Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022 is truly intended to increase protection of the public and greater financial compensation, then other regulated health professions would have been named.  However, only the TCM profession was singled out.

This is clearly a discriminatory and predatory attack on our profession.
4.	The Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 of Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022, Schedule 5, will have a direct negative impact on the public’s ability to access traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture as part of their health care.
Rather than increase pay cheques, the dissolution of the College and de-regulation of TCM and acupuncture will force many members to leave the profession due changes in earning potential and compensation.  With the loss of regulation, members may not be able to charge fees that other regulated health professionals can.

TCM and acupuncture are used with high levels of clinical efficacy to address chronic conditions that impact both physical and mental health; severe pain, depression, anxiety and stress are common examples of the conditions we can help with.  These conditions can be debilitating and limit a person’s ability to participate fully in life.  Many of our patients can attest to the relief they experience with TCM and acupuncture.

As practitioners we have witnessed firsthand the detrimental impact the lack of access to care caused when all non-essential businesseswere forced to shutdown in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.  Our patients suffered greatly during this time.

Furthermore, as stated in point number one, de-regulation of TCM and acupuncture allows individuals lacking sufficient training to practice controlled acts, which will endanger the public.  Without proper training the insertion of an acupuncture needle below the dermis and mucous membranes can cause grave injury such as pneumothorax and death.

5.	The Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 of Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022, Schedule 5, will give insurance companies the opportunity to deny the coverage of acupuncture when it is  performed by TCM-trained acupuncturists.  Instead insurance companies might favour non-TCM trained practitioners, all of whom have much less training and scope than the members of CTCMPAO. 
For some of our patients, extended health insurance benefits are the only financial resource that allows them to access TCM and acupuncture care.  This is particularly true for those in marginalized and disadvantaged socio-economic groups.
The Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 of Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022, Schedule 5 will further marginalize these groups and diminish access to care.
6.	The Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 of Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022, Schedule 5, will negatively impact the 2,760 registered members of the CTCMPAO and our ability to work within our chosen profession.
The dissolution of the College and de-regulation of TCM and acupuncture will diminish earning potential and the financial viability of practicing TCM and acupuncture as a career, causing many members to leave the profession.

Again, it will be our patients and their health that suffer most when their practitioners are no longer able to financially support themselves and their families.  These patients will no longer be able to receive TCM care or acupuncture from their trusted practitioner when that member leaves the profession.

7.	The Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 of Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022, Schedule 5, will have a negative impact on the fifteen TCM and acupuncture educational institutions, thirteen of which are private colleges and two of which are community colleges, and their staff, teaching faculty, program directors, and owners.
Across these fifteen institutions there are hundreds of people who will be negatively impacted. Their ability to make a living through their employment at these institutions will become limited.

If the CTCMPAO is dissolved, there will no longer be the requirement for such stringent TCM training.  The trickle down effect will lead to decreased job security and loss of employment, as these institutions will no longer have the influx of students to their programs.

This will further burden businesses hard hit by the pandemic and lessen their ability to generate revenue indirectly through these educational institutions, such as restaurants in the direct vicinity of the schools, , public transportation, etc.
8.	The Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 of Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022, Schedule 5, will have a negative impact on the hundreds of students enrolled in programs across the province.
These students have invested thousands of dollars on their tuition and hours of their lives to their education in exchange for the opportunity to join the regulated health profession of TCM and acupuncture.

Dissolution of the CTCMPAO and the de-regulation of TCM and acupuncture decreases the standards of practice required by members of the profession.  The investment of finances and time these students have committed will instantly be for nothing as the Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 removes safeguards that are barriers to practice for those lacking sufficient training.  Anyone would be able to practice acupuncture.
9.	The announcement of Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 of Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022, Schedule 5was abrupt and inequitable.  No stakeholders or experts were given the opportunity to make an assessment or share their testimony.
It is alarming that the College received directions to begin the wind down of operations and the de-regulation of the profession with an expected timeline of 18 months, on the same day the first reading occurred.  A bill cannot be passed, given Royal Assent, and made into law without due process.  Compelling action on Bill 88 before it goes through the entire legislative process and becomes an Act is unconstitutional.

According to How an Ontario Bill Becomes Law - a guide for legislators and the public, provided by the Legislative Research Service and the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, a bill must go through the process of deliberation and debate.  “In most instances, though, the bill is referred to a Standing Committee (or a Select Committee or the Committee of the Whole House).  The Committee may decide to hold hearings to receive testimony from citizens and expert witnesses.  Amendments are voted on in the clause-by-clause analysis that concludes the Committee’s considerations of the bill.”

It does not seem that this has been done by the Government of Ontario at this time. 

The timeline for moving this bill forward seems as though it is being fast tracked, which is suspicious given that it is an election year, with the election being less than four months away.
10.	There exists a conflict of interest between the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario and the Federation of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists (FOTCMA).
It has come to our attention that the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario has made promises to members of the Chinese community in particular PC ridings to dissolve the CTCMPAO in exchange for support during the election.
FOTCMA is a TCM and acupuncture association that attempted to sue the CTCMPAO over standards of practice.  They failed and lost two subsequent appeals with the Supreme Court of Canada.  
Hon. Christine Elliott, the Minister of Health, was seen at the appeals proceedings sitting on FOTCMA’s side of the courtroom and speaking to members of their delegation after they lost their appeal.
These political dealings indicate a clear conflict and a vested interest for the current provincial government. We respectfully call on the opposition parties and MPPs to investigate this matter further. 
11.	Within the CTCMPAO there exists a conflict of interest between some CTCMPAO professional board/council members and FOTCMA affiliation - Stephen Liu & Richard Dong.
The FOTCMA and its members are notorious for their repeated attempts to discredit, remove, and dissolve the CTCMPAO.  These legal proceedings are the reason that our membership fees remain high and increase year after year.

Two council members, Stephen Liu and Richard Dong, are known to be associated with the FOTCMA.  If they, as we allege, inserted themselves onto the College council, with the intention of dissolving the CTCMPAO, then the College did not fulfill its fiduciary duty to its members.

As such, the proceedings to enact the Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 of Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022, Schedule 5 are unconstitutional and illegal.

As such:

1.	We respectfully request that you reconsider and remove Schedule 5 of Bill 88, Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 from the Working for Workers Act, 2022.

As Chinese medicine practitioners and acupuncturists, we are in service to our patients.  The de-regulation of our profession puts those that we care for in direct risk for harm and negligent treatment at the hands of those who are unqualified to be practicing.

Thousands of your constituents; the stakeholders, members of the community, practitioners, and students would be negatively impacted by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act.

2.	We respectfully request that you allow public hearings with input from stakeholders and experts during the Review by Committee phase after the Second Reading.
	
It is only fair that those stakeholders (ie. members of the public who consume Chinese medicine and acupuncture and their family members) and experts (ie. TCM practitioners, acupuncturists, TCM educators, etc.) be able to provide testimony as Bill 88, Section 5 impacts these parties directly.

3.	We respectfully request that you answer the question of why only the TCM Act and the members of its self-governing professional body is targeted in Bill 88, Working for Workers Act, 2022.

Should Bill 88 have also targeted the Medicine Act, 1991 or the Nursing Act, 1991, would the outcomes be the same?  Absolutely not.  The question is, why is the CTCMPAO being singled out for de-regulation when the Ontario Government has spent taxpayer dollars and years to research the risk of harm to the public posed by unregulated acupuncturists?

4.	We respectfully request that you investigate the legality of the proceedings that led to Schedule 5 of Bill 88, Traditional Chinese Medicine Repeal Act, 2022 from the Working for Workers Act, 2022 and bring to light the conflict of interest and failure of the CTCMPAO to fulfill their fiduciary duties to their members due to infiltration of known associates of the FOTCMA.
These proceedings reflect poorly upon the legislative process and the province of Ontario as a whole.  It is the members of the community and the members of the profession of TCM and acupuncture and its stakeholders that will suffer as a result of these underhanded political dealings.

If you proceed and fail to protect the public, after the Ontario Government has spent years and taxpayer’s dollars to regulate TCM and acupuncture, you will be liable for the injury and harm your constituents will face.

We urge you to make the right decision.

Respectfully yours,

Registered Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario,
Professional Members of the CTCMPAO
