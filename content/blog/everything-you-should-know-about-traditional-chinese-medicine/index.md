The world of Traditional Chinese Medicine dates back decades. In this current moment, we live in a world ruled by western medicine. However, many don't know of the various alternatives that are offered. In the past ten years, we've seen an increase in interest in eastern/alternative medicine. It's great to see these alternative healing modalities grow in popularity.



# C﻿omponents of Traditional Chinese Medicine

TCM is a complete medical system and is composed of many modalities such as:

* T﻿ongue and Pulse Diagnosis

* A﻿cupressure Massage
* F﻿ire Cupping
* G﻿ua Sha
* H﻿erbal Medicine
* M﻿oxibustion
* T﻿ai Chi / Qi Gong



# T﻿raditional Chinese Medicine Today

Long before technology, observations were leading to discoveries. This is now what we see in our textbooks as Traditional Chinese Medicine students. These theories explain how our body is connected, and how the inner workings are so intricate, yet amazing. We learn that any implications for our health arise because we are unbalanced. The theories of TCM train us to find these imbalances and repair them. We can have excess or deficiencies. There are invasions of illness or lack of vital substances. TCM enlightens us that a headache is not just a headache. There is always a reason behind the pain or discomfort. Looking at the patient as an individual is how we approach problems. To see exactly why a patient is experiencing something based on their unique constitution.



Reconnecting someone to a balanced state can end up solving more problems than they even came to see practitioners for. In our busy society, most of us will spend a lifetime without experiencing optimal health. We brush things off and accept pain. Chinese medicine helps to reroute the system and create an internal/external balance. We all deserve to feel like our best selves.
