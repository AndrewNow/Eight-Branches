The Chinese Body clock is rooted and based on Ancient Traditional Chinese Medicine. The clock is based on a 24-hour period - this helps us optimize our energy by matching tasks to certain times of the day. It is said that Qi moves through the organ system every 2 hours and is a helpful tool used to discover any imbalances we may be experiencing within the body. Every Zang and Fu organ in the body gets a 2-hour time window where Qi is most concentrated, and every element gets a 4-hour window where the Qi is most concentrated.
