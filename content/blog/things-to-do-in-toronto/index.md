I know Toronto from the back of my head. Being born and raised here has taught me so many things and along the way it's brought me to some awesome places within the city. Hi, my name is Adeela, and I'd like to say I'm a tourist in my own city. This spontaneous spirit of mine has led me to wander parts of Toronto that I have grown to love so much, and I'm still exploring new places every single day!

With Toronto being a big city, it can be quite difficult to know where to go or what to do. Being that Toronto is my hometown, it's allowed me to venture off and find all the little and big things the city has to offer. Being that Toronto is so diverse - there really is something here for everyone to enjoy. Now through my experience, I have piled up the best places to experience Toronto at its core.

Be prepared because I will be unlocking some of Toronto's hidden gems (growing up here you find yourself wandering off and discovering some cool places) as well as some of the local touristy spots!

> **1. Doris McCarthy Trail**

If you're up for a hike and an awesome view this spot is great to go with a buddy or even spending some time alone. Leads from Ravine Drive, which takes you down a pathway that will take you to a beautiful view of Lake Ontario and the Scarborough Bluffs. From personal experience, if you decide to take this trail, bring water (you will thank me later!).
