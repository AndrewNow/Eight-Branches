**SAFER SIX is looking for Acupuncturists to join our expanding team** **coming Fall.** We are currently an inclusive, body-positive, trauma-informed medical clinic that will be growing from providing just medical care to an allied health community clinic that will house massage therapy, acupuncture, psychologist/psychotherapy, as well as nursing staff. 

We are located in Toronto west-end (east of High Park) at 27 Roncesvalles Avenue. We are looking for inclusive, 2SLGBQTIA+ (and allies) acupuncturists to join our team at a split % billings that will be very competitive and/or a daily clinic rate based on need and desires. We will provide all administrative support (help with patient payments, bookings/advertising), cost of supplies, and other office procedures so you can focus on doing what you love most: interacting with clients.  If you are interested in discussing opportunities to work at Safer Six, in as little as 3-5 hours per week, feel free to reach out to Dr. Andrew Bennett (medical director & lead physician) at [info@safersix.ca](mailto:info@safersix.ca)
