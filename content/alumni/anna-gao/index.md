Anna is an expert in fertility and hormonal imbalance.﻿ ﻿

Anna has been working in the fertility industry for over 10 years.﻿

She helps couples get and stay pregnant naturally and maximize chances of IVF/IUI success using acupuncture, nutritional supplements, dietary and lifestyle counseling and mind-body medicine.﻿

﻿﻿Her goal of becoming a Fertility Acupuncturist started back in 2010, when Anna started working as clinical assistant and manager at Positive Chinese Medicine under Jinglan Li Burns who now has retired in 2021. Over the decade, Anna learned invaluable clinical pearls from Jinglan, her aunt, who was a medical doctor and Chinese medicine doctor in China. Anna later learned that her great grandfather was also a herbalist in the late 1800’s. She took it as a sign that the practice of medicine was what she was destined for.

Witnessing how acupuncture and Chinese medicine had been the answer for many couples, Anna was determined to be a Fertility Acupuncturist and help as many people as she can with their fertility struggles. She's determined to help her patients to get + stay pregnant and take home a healthy baby.

Today Anna continues the collaboration with some of the top physicians in the field, notably, Dr. Garcia, Dr. Wais and Dr. Chan at Markham Fertility Centre (MFC).

The founder of MFC, Dr. Virro had once said the East combining the West approach had shown a *“skyrocketed increase in IVF success rate”*. And no one agrees with this more today than Anna’s fertility patients.﻿
