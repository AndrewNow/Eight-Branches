Graduated at Eight Branches with his Acupuncture & Moxibustion Diploma - Rian uses acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping and sound therapy alongside West African indigenous healing and counselling methods to support and strengthen individuals, families and communities’ felt sense of health and wellness. In practice from 2014, he has a general family practice focusing on treating digestive issues, pain conditions, stress and anxiety, fertility and women’s and men’s health as well as spiritual concerns. In addition, Rian has also been successful in providing support for those receiving various forms of cancer care.

It was Rian’s experiences learning from some great healers and teachers which allowed him to take an integrative approach to wellness combining diagnostic principles and therapies rooted in Traditional East Asian Medicine with those of Ancestral reconnection, divination and spiritual healing rooted in the Ifá tradition. He is passionate about offering healthcare using a natural and a non-invasive approach to wellness. Central to his practice is the importance he places on patient education and self-care as a means to taking ownership over one’s health outcomes.
