Pauline is an Ontario-licensed Registered Acupuncturist (R.Ac.) and Registered Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner (R.TCMP). She is an Eight Branches Alumni and has done many wonderful endeavours after post-graduation! Pauline uses acupuncture, herbs, moxibustion, nutrition, cupping, acupressure, mindfulness meditation and wellness coaching to support people through cancer treatment, recovery and prevention. In practice since 2012, she also treats many general practice patients whose health concerns are not cancer-related (e.g. pain, digestion, insomnia, anxiety, stress, women’s health, fertility, depression, auto-immune conditions, etc.). She is a sought-after teacher and lecturer in the health and wellness field, especially in supportive cancer care. 



She is now the proud owner of [Hillgreen Oncology Acupuncture & Herbs](https://oncologyacupuncture.ca/), which cooperates with the [Marsden Centre for Excellence in Integrative Medicine](https://oncologyacupuncture.ca/pauline#), one of the leading naturopathic oncology clinics in Canada, to offer effective, evidence-informed natural supportive care to people with cancer and their loved ones.
