Carrie is a registered acupuncturist and traditional Chinese medicine practitioner with a love of the Taoist roots of the practice.  Taoism, which is all about living in harmony with the natural world, relates strongly to the human body.  Treating the body well and allowing it the time and space to heal itself is essential to Carrie’s practice.  We all have the power to heal ourselves; Carrie sees herself as a servant or supporter of her patients on the journey towards living a peaceful, healthy and balanced life.

Carrie is adept at working with musculoskeletal issues, including back, neck and shoulder pain and chronic issues such as arthritis.  She is also accomplished at working with gynecological and digestive issues, such as dysmenorrhea, IBS, and indigestion issues.  However, Carrie’s real passion is to work with people with psycho-emotional and mental health issues.  Her extensive background in meditation, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and yoga allow her to use acupuncture and Chinese herbs to work with patients suffering from depression or anxiety, for example.  Carrie is a gifted acupuncturist and herbalist who really enjoys working with and treating people.

Carrie comes to acupuncture from work as a teacher.  Her extensive teaching experiences in the USA, Japan, China, Thailand and Canada all contribute to her comfort in working with clients of all ages, including children, and from all backgrounds.  Her teaching background also comes in handy as she is skillful at discussing the ways in which Chinese medicine works and providing “homework” in the form of exercises or herbal medicine for her clients.  In addition to working at this clinic, Carrie currently teaches with us at Eight Branches.
