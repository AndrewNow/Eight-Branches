Carolyn is a Registered Acupuncturist with a Bachelor’s Degree in Health Science and a Diploma in Acupuncture and Moxibution. She has a love for cupping therapy, mobility training and fascial release work. In conjunction with pain management, she focuses her practice on internal health, stress and anxiety management, neurological rehabilitation and chronic disease. With a comprehensive understanding of Western and Eastern medicine, she is dedicated to creating treatment protocols that are individualized to suit her clients. Carolyn also has additional training in Cosmetic Acupuncture and Functional Range Conditioning.

Carolyn is fueled by a constant hunger for learning new techniques and approaches to incorporate into her practice. Her passion lies in developing treatments that encourage your body to heal itself. To this end she has pursued additional training in Cupping Therapy, Fascial Stretch Therapy and Functional Range Conditioning, and continues to expand her practice with advanced training in Neurofunctional/Sports Acupuncture.

Carolyn’s training in both Eastern and Western medicine gives her the unique ability to incorporate both modern and traditional modalities in her treatments, allowing her to create treatment protocols designed to suit your individual needs from a holistic, biomedical and physiological point of view. Combining her skills as a Massage Therapist and Acupuncturist, Carolyn has the ability to treat a variety of conditions and patients – from athletes to those suffering from chronic debilitating conditions and pain. 

With an open minded analysis, Carolyn always assesses the body from the inside out. Perhaps that kink in your neck you’ve had for 3 months isn’t your pillow, but the increased stress load at work or home. How about that persistent achy right shoulder – could it maybe have something to do with chronic indigestion and stomach cramps? With a hands on approach, she’ll work out those areas of tension while addressing the underlying causes. She is a firm believer in empowering and educating her clients to achieve the best and long lasting results.

Carolyn is now an RMT, acupuncturist, and clinic director at Axis Therapy & Performance.
