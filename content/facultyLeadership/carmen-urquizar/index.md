Maria Del Carmen Urquizar is a Registered Acupuncturist, with the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists (CTCMPAO), practicing in Toronto, Ontario. She works with her patients to develop comprehensive and personalized treatment plans that holistically restore their physical, emotional and mental well-being. Carmen’s treatments are designed to not only relieve her patient’s symptoms, but treat the underlying root cause of the disease as well; thus she focuses her practice on Acupuncture, Moxibustion, Cupping, Guasha, Tuina and Dietary Chinese Nutrition to bring your health into an overall state of balance and harmony.

Carmen’s professional background includes practicing as a Registered Nurse in Spain for over 10 years, during which time she offered her services to Community health, Cardiology, Internal medicine, Oncology, Intensive Unit Care, as well as volunteering in Africa (Guinea Bissau). This professional experience has allowed Carmen to broaden her perspectives on health and understand diseases from a Western medicine standpoint to be used concomitantly with her practice in Eastern medicine.

As of 2012, Carmen has also been practicing TaiJi and Qi Gong as a part of self-healing by harmonizing her Body and Mind, which has been a valuable tool in her practice when treating clients.

Empathy, compassion and acceptance are her day to day values; she works effortlessly to address her patients concerns and is dedicated in her treatment. Carmen believes that you never truly stop learning and is consistently looking to sharpen her skills and enhance her knowledge of healing; she is continuing her education in Traditional Chinese Medicine with the study of Medicinal herbology to further expand her practice.
