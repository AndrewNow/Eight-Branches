Ana’s passion for learning and her engagement with client care motivated her to complete her Zen Shiatsu Diploma Program in 2009, Massage Therapy Diploma Program in 2013 and then her Acupuncture & Moxibustion Diploma Program in 2018. Ana has also been exposed to Eastern philosophical practices and was also privileged to learn medical Qi gong, tai chi, tao yin, hara breathing, Vipassana meditation and chanting.​

Ana is very determined to provide her clients with the ability to experience the deep peace and quietness that she first discovered, as well as to hold a space in which her clients can receive healing and support.

Her practice includes a vast selection of modalities that will rejuvenate and nourish your body during and after each treatment. Whether you receive a therapeutic massage, zen shiatsu, cupping or acupuncture session she incorporates her skilled mindfulness, palpa-tion and practical techniques in a tranquil atmosphere.

As of 2019, Ana has also become an instructor at Eight Branches teaching tuina and clinical observation. Ana is both a patient as well as a practitioner, who appreciates the benefits of massage therapy and Traditional Chinese Medicine in her own life.
